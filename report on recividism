COMPAS Bias Audit Report (300 Words)

This analysis examined the COMPAS two-year recidivism dataset to assess potential racial disparities in risk classification. Using the decile score as the standard measure of predicted risk, individuals were labeled “high risk” if their COMPAS decile score was greater than or equal to five, consistent with common fairness audits in criminal justice research.

The findings revealed clear differences in selection rates (the proportion of individuals labeled high risk) across racial groups. African-American defendants exhibited the highest high-risk classification rate, while Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic individuals displayed significantly lower rates. These results align with prior investigations, including ProPublica’s 2016 report, which found that COMPAS disproportionately labeled African Americans as higher risk despite similar or lower rates of actual reoffending compared to white defendants.

The disparity suggests that the model may be reflecting racial bias embedded in the historical data used for training. Factors such as policing patterns, historical arrest rates, and socioeconomic inequalities can inadvertently influence risk scores even when race is not explicitly used as a feature. As a result, marginalized groups may experience unfair treatment, including harsher bail decisions, longer supervision periods, or unequal sentencing outcomes.

To remediate these issues, several interventions are recommended. First, fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact Ratio, Equal Opportunity Difference, and False Positive Rate by race should be systematically evaluated before deployment. Second, the model should be retrained using bias-reduction techniques, including reweighing, adversarial debiasing, or removing features highly correlated with protected attributes. Third, algorithmic transparency should be improved by providing clear explanations of risk factors influencing predictions. This allows stakeholders—judges, attorneys, and defendants—to challenge or verify decisions. Finally, periodic audits should be mandated to ensure long-term fairness and compliance with ethical AI principles.

In conclusion, while COMPAS provides structured risk assessment capabilities, significant racial disparities persist. A responsible approach requires continuous auditing, transparent operations, and active mitigation of biases to ensure equitable outcomes in criminal justice decision-making.
